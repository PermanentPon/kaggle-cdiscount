## [Cdiscount’s Image Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cdiscount-image-classification-challenge)
This is my solution for Cdiscount’s Image Classification Challenge on Kaggle.
The main idea is to train two models on disjoint data. First model on first images of products and second one on all other images. After that use the resultant output to build a FC net for final classification
## Result
Public LB - 151st (top 25%)
## Structure
5 notebooks:
1. BSON to files - generates folders with images from bson files
2. Images  augmentation & over-under sampling - augments adds images in classes with small number of images and delete images in categories with too many images.
3. Keras modeling from files - traines models from files
4. Testing base models and ensambles - code to test trained models and make ensembles of models
5. Train and test 2_layers_FC on top - creates a new FC net on top of feateres from last layer of the base CNN for all images of products (from 1 to 4 images)
## How to use
Run all the cells in all the files one by one from 1 to 5.
